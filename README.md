 Colton also updated the database to be more flexible with data and security
 Randy styled the login, signup, account, and landing page while implementing routes
 Randy also created rest api's that encrypt data and send and query data form the db
 We both worked with the database to fix the api so the user can sign up and login successfully


# Current Progress as of 2/7/2024
 So far Randy has completed a lot of the applications code and we are now onto the development of the network side of the program.
 Randy has been working on setting up the application to be able to connect to the database in order to run queries and procedures.
 Colton constructed and has been running the MySQL Database on a Local Server successfully connecting between 2 machines.
 Colton has constructed a final procedural setup for easier input of data and is working on writing queries for the application to run when connected to the database.
 Colton has worked on more security features and is focusing on a salt-hash password encrytion system in order to follow modern security standards for database and web development.
 The two of them have decided on the finalized features and are now working on implementing them together in order for it to properly work. User account creation and data storage will be next after networking is successful.

# Current Progress as of 1-27-24

 We both worked on the UI and DB design.
