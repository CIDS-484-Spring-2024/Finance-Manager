# Authors
## Randy Franzmeier and Colton Williams

# Overview
## This application will take in user financial information, and display results based off of their needs. 
## Ideally, the user will login or create an account, be able to manage their finances, and even recieve tips.

# Current Progress as of 1-27-24
## So far, we have decided on our technology stack, planned and researched tools, designed a boiler plate UI,
## and created a basic backend, frontend, and sqlite db template. We plan on adding Azure when the project is more developed.
## Randy got the front and backend set up.
## Colton constructed a plan for the database and some sample queries to run.
## We both worked on the UI and DB design.

# Tech stack
